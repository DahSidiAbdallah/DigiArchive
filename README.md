- [x] Archive view (filter by BLs, Devis, Factures, etc.)
- [ ] User activity logging (Audit trail) (Planned)
**Deliverables:**
  - [x] Document explorer UI
  - [x] Search bar with filters
  - [ ] Audit trail per file (Planned)
  - [ ] Export (PDF, Excel) options (Planned)

### Phase 4: Internal Chat & Collaboration
**Goal:** Add team interaction
- [ ] Real-time internal chat (Planned)
  - [ ] Chat per file (‚Äúcomments‚Äù on documents)
  - [ ] Departmental threads
- [ ] Socket.IO backend (Planned)
- [ ] Notifications for mentions or new uploads (Planned)
- [ ] Chat history stored & archived (Planned)
**Deliverables:**
  - [ ] Functional internal chat (Planned)
  - [ ] Integration into document view (Planned)
  - [ ] Mention/tag system (Planned)

### Phase 5: Validation & Approval Flows
**Goal:** Structured document workflows
- [ ] Add document status system: Draft > Submitted > Approved > Archived (Planned)
- [ ] Notification system for validation (Planned)
- [ ] Permissioned approval roles (Planned)
- [ ] Time stamping & user signature for accountability (Planned)
**Deliverables:**
  - [ ] Approvals dashboard (Planned)
  - [ ] Validation logic per department (Planned)
  - [ ] Notification system (email or dashboard) (Planned)

### Phase 6: Analytics & Audit Reporting
**Goal:** Insights + compliance
- [ ] Dashboards:
  - [ ] Monthly uploads by department (Planned)
  - [ ] Delay between upload & validation (Planned)
  - [ ] Number of documents by type (Planned)
- [ ] Export full logs for audits (Planned)
- [ ] AI assistant (optional later): Ask questions like: "Show me all unpaid bills from last month" (Planned)
**Deliverables:**
  - [ ] Dashboard with KPIs (Planned)
  - [ ] Downloadable audit reports (Planned)
  - [ ] System-wide log viewer (Planned)
